# TOAPI
An extensive C# library for learning how to do P/Invoke against Win32 

Introduction
============

In Hindi, Toapi means “hat”, or something that covers.  In the context of the TOAPI libraries, it means: This Old Application Programming Interface (TOAPI).  This is ancienct code, originally written in the 2006 timeframe, when the CLR was young, and the Windows Runtime wasn't even a glimmer in anyone's eye.  It is a very thin library that gives CLR language programmers easy access to common Windows APIs.  
First and foremost the library is designed as a teaching tool so that engineers who are new to the .net programming environment, and even to Windows programming, can learn how to do interesting things using CLR languages sooner rather than later.

This library has been pulled out of the NewTOAPIA repository, and resurrected due to a renewed interest in teaching the subject of learning C# from the ground up.  If you intend to program Windows using C#, you would be much better served to simply use the SDKs provided with the C# language as everything done by TOAPI has now been supported by Microsoft itself, and a whole lot more.  If you intention is to have your own library to play with, and explore different ways of doing things, then this might be a viable library for you.
